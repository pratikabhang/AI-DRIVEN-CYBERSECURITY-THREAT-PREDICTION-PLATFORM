## Reporting a Vulnerability

Use this section to tell people how to report a vulnerability.

Tell them where to go, how often they can expect to get an update on a
reported vulnerability, what to expect if the vulnerability is accepted or
declined, etc.

### How to Report

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly by
contacting the project maintainers.

* **Do not** open a public GitHub issue for security-related problems.
* Send details privately via email or the official security contact channel.
* Include as much information as possible, such as:

  * A clear description of the issue
  * Steps to reproduce the vulnerability
  * Potential impact
  * Any relevant logs, screenshots, or proof-of-concept code

### Response Timeline

* You can expect an **initial acknowledgment within 48–72 hours**.
* We will provide periodic updates while the issue is being investigated.
* Once confirmed, we will work on a fix and coordinate a responsible disclosure.

### Vulnerability Handling

* **Accepted vulnerabilities** will be patched as soon as possible and released
  in a supported version.
* **Declined reports** (e.g., non-security issues or known limitations) will be
  explained with reasoning.

### Supported Disclosure

We appreciate responsible disclosure and ask that you allow us reasonable
time to address the issue before making it public.

### Scope

This security policy applies only to:

* Official releases
* Supported versions listed above

Issues found in unsupported versions may not be addressed.
