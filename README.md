## 📌 Short Description (GitHub About)

An **AI-powered autonomous cybersecurity system** that monitors network activity in real time, predicts cyber threats, and responds intelligently with minimal human intervention.

---

## 📝 Problem Statement

Modern cybersecurity systems heavily rely on human analysts, making them slow, reactive, and error-prone. With the increasing scale and complexity of cyber-attacks, manual monitoring is no longer sufficient.

This project proposes an **agentic AI-based cybersecurity system** that acts as an autonomous guardian. The AI agents continuously monitor network traffic, detect anomalies, predict threats, and generate real-time security insights without constant human supervision.
